# osu!streamix
 osu!stream 2010 beta client, modified to look like stable
## IMPORTANT TODO:
- add android support
- add pause screen
- fix the touch detection of sprites (theyre really off)
- add keyboard support
- fix the circlesize and ui size
- add cursor
- make song selection system closer to stable
- make button types (ability to call for a back button instead of making one on every page for example)

## Less important to do
- private server support
- skinning support
- make the followpoints rotated
